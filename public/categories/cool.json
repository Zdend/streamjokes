But I've been through things that have made me a stronger person, and if I can help some people, I will.","c":"cool","a":"Fergie"},{"id":"IBr5lj7jmDDZQ","t":"If I wasn't even famous or had any success, I would still wake up and put tons of make-up on, and put on a cool outfit. That's always been who I've been my whole life, so that's never gonna change. I love fashion. I love getting dressed up. I love Halloween, too.","c":"cool","a":"Gwen Stefani"},{"id":"SvWRbt6eYLaNT","t":"Again, like I said, we're not trying to censor anyone. If you think drugs are cool, fine. Make that movie. We are not going to stop you, or try to stop you, but we would encourage other people to be a bit more responsible about their portrayal of drug usage.","c":"cool","a":"Gerald McRaney"},{"id":"Sbs_PttGGhPqD","t":"I am surprised by how not-adopted the video reply has been. What keeps other people from doing it, I think, is that they think a video comes across as 'I'm cool, look at how many e-mails I get.' That perception doesn't scare me, because I know who I am.","c":"cool","a":"Gary Vaynerchuk"},{"id":"8CIcwKSY6wxmX","t":"Robert De Niro...

I thought my pink leopard boots were so cool.","c":"cool","a":"Brittany Snow"},{"id":"6WjUtSayusNRA","t":"I joined MySpace in September 2003. At that time no one was on there at all. I felt like a loser while all the cool kids were at some other school. So I mass e-mailed between 30,000 and 50,000 people and told them to come over. Everybody joined overnight.","c":"cool","a":"Tila Tequila"},{"id":"E5epr-Ku8hVN8","t":"When I was 24, I was full of life. I was that ham who wanted to be famous, a movie star, all that stuff. I think it's cool. But it was not what I was searching for, really. It was more a delusion.","c":"cool","a":"Jean Claude Van Damme"},{"id":"8UIy9MttACmm8","t":"Like I said about Freaked, people tend to find these films, and I think that in the end the cool thing about a movie is that it can be sort of burnt temporarily, but then it's burnt into the fabric of your culture.","c":"cool","a":"Alex Winter"},{"id":"h-VuXjBgBIRo_","t":"I don't go to the cool, trendy restaurants. I go to either the holes in the wall or the super-fancy restaurants where there are no cool people.","c":"cool","a":"Tyra Banks"},{"id":"T1Pg1zoav7BrW","t":"I try not to name too many labels - not because it's not cool, but because it starts getting political.","c":"cool","a":"Nelly"},{"id":"ceUr_i0ov4F7X","t":"When you're 14, anything with a sword and a dragon is pretty cool. But when you're 21 and you've read 2,000 fantasy novels, you start to realize that some of those books, well, they weren't really good. OK, let's be honest. A lot of them were crap.","c":"cool","a":"Patrick Rothfuss","e":true},{"id":"-nLc6i44BkIG4","t":"People are more comfortable learning about wine because now they can just Google, you know, 'Soave,' and say, 'Oh, O.K., cool.'","c":"cool","a":"Gary Vaynerchuk"},{"id":"XUuWYR5u3ZQoH","t":"The idea of recognising your strengths and using them in as versatile a way as you can is cool to me.","c":"cool","a":"Frank Ocean"},{"id":"1aMac_-3u_W69","t":"And I now think that Stratocasters and Telecasters are way cool.","c":"cool","a":"John Fogerty"},{"id":"EmzvtGZuupT_Z","t":"I know some actors feel classes are not cool or they create negative public relations, but I continue to crave the story just beyond my reach. To grasp that brass ring I need to continue to fine-tune my talents.","c":"cool","a":"Michael Welch"},{"id":"fxh0ekzrFjy7V","t":"It's the same with visual arts, you have some really cool, wonderful striking images that make you think and then again you have wonderful striking images that just take you away from the existing world for a second. And I like the latter a bit more.","c":"cool","a":"Ville Valo"},{"id":"Q9f5ZfXQy2Hjm","t":"I was 35 years old and in a position to take a shot at whatever I wanted to try. The Air Force said I was too old to fly fighter jets.

Need help? You should use more forceful language, you'll get more money.'","c":"cool","a":"Demetri Martin"},{"id":"cCebbW2PR2s0Q","t":"I got tired of the Ramones around the time I quit and I really got into rap. I thought it was the new punk rock. LL Cool J was my biggest idol.","c":"cool","a":"Dee Dee Ramone"},{"id":"trXPrPRy5_SHF","t":"My purpose is to make a movie to make you warm. To give you some heat. Now, this rational world has become a place where only what is cool is good.

Even if the answer's no, I'm totally cool with it.","c":"cool","a":"Corbin Bleu"},{"id":"-bdVW_-1knFCA","t":"I try to explain to people that you get the roles that are right when they're right. If you have a nerd character but you're kind of a cool guy, you're probably not going to get the nerd part. The nerd is going to get the nerd part. You know, someone like me.","c":"cool","a":"Ed Helms"},{"id":"_Cnmhb_68Mrty","t":"The high-spirited man may indeed die, but he will not stoop to meanness. Fire, though it may be quenched, will not become cool.","c":"cool","a":"Ovid"},{"id":"na7Zx-Y6hduZ0","t":"51st State was one that I loved doing because the character was so out there, and in a way I was sad to leave the character behind.

My parents were enthusiastic about the move, so my older brother and I felt like we were off to some place kind of cool.","c":"cool","a":"Greg Kinnear"},{"id":"Rm4VNnQ9DF8Gc","t":"I like to give dimension to shots inside action scenes. It's demanding because you have to rehearse a lot of things happening at the same time and frame all those things in a shot. But I feel like when you accomplish that then you've got a cool action scene.","c":"cool","a":"Jose Padilha"},{"id":"P8qBq76lDpQvM","t":"And of course I've got kids of my own now, and they love me being in the Harry Potter films. I'm now part of a phenomenon. You become incredibly cool to your kids, and you get a young fan base. So you became the cool dad at school. You're suddenly hip.","c":"cool","a":"Gary Oldman"},{"id":"9oxQu2GuAN55n","t":"We used to play the underground clubs like the UFO, and Middle Earth, and they were great because they would have on things like a poet, string quartets, and then a rock band!

Then I started thinking about how cool it was.","c":"cool","a":"Brandon Routh"},{"id":"ilUDh26xZz3D6","t":"More and more, Democrats are starting to worry they that they have a more um, colorful version of Jimmy Carter on their hands.

He's too cool to be clapping One Direction though.","c":"cool","a":"Zayn Malik"},{"id":"_rPNEDwlXMKA-","t":"It's fun to be a part of pop history. Anytime you can be referenced in that respect it can be cool.","c":"cool","a":"Joey McIntyre"},{"id":"V9vqRDbmvSb72","t":"When I think of the definition of cool and when I look at people, John Travolta is really the definition of cool because, not only is he great in all his movies, but, as a person, he's just really cool.","c":"cool","a":"Christina Milian"},{"id":"7uADYUziJcNBy","t":"Look at Neil Diamond.

He just did what he did - made great music, was a good entertainer, nice-enough guy.","c":"cool","a":"Michael Buble"},{"id":"-q1ZFd8A0aDNG","t":"Rhyme patterns are nothing without meanings to the words. A lot of rappers can do those flows, but the raps aren't really about anything - which is cool sometimes, but to have the flow and the message is one of my favorite things.","c":"cool","a":"J.

You have to come in at the right place, which is different than me singing the blues, where I can sing, 'Oh, baby,' if there's a pause in the melody.
