Every country I visit, I have a different boyfriend. And I kiss them all.","c":"dating","a":"Anna Kournikova"},{"id":"biHstzbVQ0ZV-","t":"Frankly, the reason I joined MENSA is because I was dating a guy at the time who spoke five languages and could solve a Rubik's Cube literally with his eyes closed because it's just an algorithm.","c":"dating","a":"Ashley Rickards"},{"id":"ekKmmr5FVklUW","t":"Relationships in general make people a bit nervous. It's about trust. Do I trust you enough to go there?","c":"dating","a":"Neil LaBute"},{"id":"tkDbDKmt_X53m","t":"I always say now that I'm in my blonde years. Because since the end of my marriage, all of my girlfriends have been blonde.","c":"dating","a":"Hugh Hefner","e":true},{"id":"VQ6DaP_Eapsoe","t":"My daughter's mother and I are no longer dating, and the people I'm most likely to date are those around me, who are athletes.","c":"dating","a":"Tyson Gay"},{"id":"JCsddAeEf7UQe","t":"I like the idea of dating, but I'm not dating anyone exclusively, particularly right now. It's hard to be in a relationship unless you're ready to go public with it. So it's a lot easier for me to not be in a relationship. I really don't want that part of my life to be tabloid fodder.","c":"dating","a":"Cory Monteith"},{"id":"Pr74pgz_VfaK8","t":"I fantasize about going back to high school with the knowledge I have now. I would shine. I would have a good time, I would have a girlfriend. I think that's where a lot of my pain comes from. I think I never had any teenage years to go back to.","c":"dating","a":"Spalding Gray"},{"id":"eLUKThekrZdDP","t":"I don't really believe in rules, but I do like old-fashioned dating where you don't call the guy until he calls you. I don't think it's like he's got to do this and that's the rule.","c":"dating","a":"Ashley Tisdale"},{"id":"MVulgwP41NtZD","t":"The Google algorithm was a significant development. I've had thank-you emails from people whose lives have been saved by information on a medical website or who have found the love of their life on a dating website.","c":"dating","a":"Tim Berners-Lee"},{"id":"jAfKPMWpHhYtt","t":"You show your vulnerability through relationships, and those feelings are your soft spot. You need to have a soft spot.","c":"dating","a":"Victoria Pratt"},{"id":"LVBQ0pfkqKn-R","t":"I highly suggest marriage to all my friends who are dating.","c":"dating","a":"Jerry O'Connell"},{"id":"mQ5AXk2N905RC","t":"I started dating older men, and I would fall in love with them. I thought they could teach me about life.","c":"dating","a":"Daphne Zuniga"},{"id":"uOlVLhgQPuYEV","t":"I think more dating stuff is scheduling. It's needing people who understand your work schedule.","c":"dating","a":"Jennifer Love Hewitt"},{"id":"V6Pddssup_UuD","t":"It was funny actually because that was still during the time we were dating. He would get all these calls because supposedly before we broke up, we had already broken up in the trades, in the rags or whatever.","c":"dating","a":"Rosario Dawson"},{"id":"7fePPSFKQfvsm","t":"It's weird to have people so interested in your personal life. It's a part of the business that grosses me out. I'm always bummed out for people who just happen to be dating a celebrity, and they're also famous, and they can't live their life.","c":"dating","a":"Andy Samberg"},{"id":"VzzujyU2ynZlX","t":"Thank God I never got in a fight. All of the jock dudes hated me, but all of their girlfriends thought I was nice so they wouldn't touch me. It was infuriating to them.","c":"dating","a":"Mark Hoppus"},{"id":"zsGBCIHCa3Egi","t":"I have put gay dating on the map.","c":"dating","a":"Patti Stanger"},{"id":"sFK1Kbz5L_sFQ","t":"Workshops and seminars are basically financial speed dating for clueless people.","c":"dating","a":"Doug Coupland"},{"id":"cfTPlWAFtl0hc","t":"Appearance is something you should definitely consider when you're going out.

I am quite demanding.","c":"dating","a":"Anne Robinson"},{"id":"ZmujRejvO0Wdv","t":"If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure.","c":"dating","a":"Joe Rogan"},{"id":"2tJ2hA_HfQWyt","t":"I'm not old-fashioned when it comes to dating, but there's something nice about a guy pulling out a girl's chair and opening the door for her, even if it's just in the beginning.","c":"dating","a":"Lauren Conrad"},{"id":"shFEP9pLQGWTE","t":"Like many of you, I've always been slightly obsessed with vampires, dating back to the prime-time series 'Dark Shadows,' which I followed avidly as a kid.","c":"dating","a":"Bill Condon"},{"id":"YgVEjAFoatlxk","t":"It's just me and my 6-month-old puppy. I am not dating anyone.","c":"dating","a":"Bridget Hall"},{"id":"9JXeRRgSSFSI9","t":"The prospect of dating someone in her twenties becomes less appealing as you get older. At some point in your fife, your tolerance level goes down and you realize that, with someone much younger, there's nothing really to talk about.","c":"dating","a":"Clint Eastwood"},{"id":"Tl8izvamzKGAG","t":"At the time that I knew them, they were not living together. They began dating again after their divorce, so I didn't really see fighting.","c":"dating","a":"Kato Kaelin"},{"id":"-fjj61W7xOQ8K","t":"We had two rules growing up in my house: If you're going to take a shower, do it with whomever you're dating so you don't waste water and if you buy one for yourself, buy six, because everybody's going to want one.","c":"dating","a":"Moon Unit Zappa"},{"id":"6bucz65FUdJTJ","t":"I'm not cynical about marriage or romance. I enjoyed being married. And although being single was fun for a while, there was always the risk of dating someone who'd owned a lunch box with my picture on it.","c":"dating","a":"Shaun Cassidy"},{"id":"BCses1TCbXi5U","t":"I can't even find someone for a platonic relationship, much less the kind where someone wants to see me naked.","c":"dating","a":"Gilbert Gottfried","e":true},{"id":"cxHbT0gl8sWA0","t":"I think feminism's a bit misinterpreted. It was about casting off all gender roles. There's nothing wrong with a man holding a door open for a girl. But we sort of threw away all the rules, so everybody's confused. And dating becomes a sloppy, uncomfortable, unpleasant thing.","c":"dating","a":"Zosia Mamet"},{"id":"DMvRmz4Bgl9gW","t":"Rumors about me? Calista Flockhart, Pam Anderson, and Matt Damon. That's who I'm dating.","c":"dating","a":"Ben Affleck"},{"id":"t520sk9nC0moS","t":"I'm very open to dating and finding a guy.","c":"dating","a":"Kristin Cavallari"},{"id":"Mpo6rZCYQuxiO","t":"If there hadn't been women we'd still be squatting in a cave eating raw meat, because we made civilization in order to impress our girlfriends.","c":"dating","a":"Orson Welles"},{"id":"d6v_iFj0IjpH9","t":"I can't even explain to you how terrible that feels, that I equate dating a woman with punishment, shame, guilt, disappointment, reproach, reprimand, persecution. It's a nightmare.","c":"dating","a":"John Mayer"},{"id":"ate4CeuhQj4oL","t":"Mary Tyler Moore was a working woman whose story lines were not always about dating and men. They were about work friendships and relationships, which is what I feel my adult life has mostly been about.","c":"dating","a":"Tina Fey"},{"id":"vuSHiS47B1aje","t":"In my own relationships, I know that I should break up with someone who doesn't encourage me to be strong and make my own choices and do what's best in my life, so if you're dating someone who doesn't want you to be the best person you can be, you shouldn't be dating them.","c":"dating","a":"Veronica Roth"},{"id":"GFgRG0HGvWLDx","t":"Pamela Anderson Lee released a statement confirming that she has had her breast implants removed.

Relationships are complex. Outcomes are uncertain. People are irrational.","c":"dating","a":"Hugh Mackay"},{"id":"zZYzsnC-RCIk3","t":"Years later I would hear my father say the divorce had left him dating his children. That still meant picking us up every Sunday for a matinee and, if he had the money, an early dinner somewhere.","c":"dating","a":"Andre Dubus III"}]
