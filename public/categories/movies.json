I wanted to do something else that could make us smile. This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times.","c":"movies","a":"Steven Spielberg"},{"id":"7a1gNyoWcR30Z","t":"The core of the movie business remains intact and it's not descending in scope. Studios want movies that are bigger than ever.","c":"movies","a":"Joel Silver"},{"id":"2rbc4168R4w6B","t":"I'm not going to have a perfect career. It's better to be Billy Wilder and make lots of movies and have five or six great ones than to make so few movies that when you make a bad one it crushes you.","c":"movies","a":"Jason Reitman"},{"id":"UshkR90HHJfO8","t":"I'm a person who likes these sort of movies... sad but moving 'art movies' that normally are at a festival and then they go to a small art house theater and disappear.","c":"movies","a":"Zach Braff"},{"id":"UrZ0HU5U-kczV","t":"My interest in film is sort of catholic - apart from science fiction and horror movies, I'll watch almost everything.","c":"movies","a":"James Dyson"},{"id":"v2NFlDYVOUQYR","t":"When I started to watch some of the films I'd done, I realized I was doing movies that I might not actually want to see.","c":"movies","a":"Heath Ledger"},{"id":"BLC5auGMMBxEZ","t":"I've made three musical movies which is pretty good considering that not many are made but I was lucky in other ways. I came along when independent movies were starting to boom.","c":"movies","a":"Christopher Walken"},{"id":"yEmqgi8I95ONG","t":"My agent said, 'You aren't good enough for movies.' I said, 'You're fired.'","c":"movies","a":"Sally Field"},{"id":"O2qKms5WI2bYC","t":"In terms of the romantic kind of lead, I just never enjoy those movies very much. Maybe they'll come to interest me more as I get older. I doubt it, but maybe. Romantic comedies tend to be, for me, an oxymoron.","c":"movies","a":"Christian Bale"},{"id":"JnJ49FwlgQiJS","t":"The reason I keep making movies is I hate the last thing I did. I'm trying to rectify my wrongs.","c":"movies","a":"Joaquin Phoenix"},{"id":"67tMlh68Vh7Dg","t":"I usually do get the tomboy parts in the movies, which is kind of like me, but not totally.

Other days I think, what am I doing in the movies? I wanna go back to Ireland and drive a forklift.","c":"movies","a":"Liam Neeson"},{"id":"X7HzSNfsKMQTl","t":"To me, movies and music go hand in hand.
