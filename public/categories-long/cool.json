You know, someone like me.","cat":"cool","author":"Ed Helms"},{"text":"The high-spirited man may indeed die, but he will not stoop to meanness. Fire, though it may be quenched, will not become cool.","cat":"cool","author":"Ovid"},{"text":"51st State was one that I loved doing because the character was so out there, and in a way I was sad to leave the character behind.
